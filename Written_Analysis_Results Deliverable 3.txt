# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the correlation between outcomes vs. goals, and theater outcomes by launch date over time.

## Analysis and Challenges

	*Two separate analyses were completed during this exercise
	*The first analysis analyzed the relationship between outcomes based on goals
	*The second analysis analyzed theater outcomes (successful, failed and canceled) based on launch date over time.
	*The dataset provided presented its own level of challenge in that it is not all-encompassing. This is only a subset of data, presenting outliers/questions on what is being provided to analyze.
	*By looking further into the trends presented in this dataset, the challenge of reviewing a small selection of data was overcome in this scenario. Focusing on a subset of data helped to narrow down the overall trends.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

	*During the month of July, successful and failed theater outcomes experienced a significant increase; 
	*Canceled outcomes during the month of July plateaued and did not increase or decrease.
	*Successful outcomes during July increased by 120- this leads us to question what the contributing factors are in why theater was more successful during the month of July.
	*There appears to be a correlation between summer months (June-August) and the success of theater outcomes- is there a possibility to explore the trend in which summer leads to more time for outside activities?

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


	*Percentage of failed goals appeared to have no relation to overall outcomes
	*Percentage successful and percentage canceled experienced a decline at 50000 or more
	*Percentage canceled plateaued at 100% until the steep downward trend at 50000 or more

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

	*The data presented in both datasets does not encompass all time periods, making it difficult to analyze overarching trends.
	*Within the Outcomes Based on Goal analysis, percentage failed was not included in the dataset (or was insignificant), skewing the trend more towards percentage sucessful and canceled.
	*Within the Theater Outcomes by Launch data, there appears to be a data gap in canceled dates between March and May- does this mean there was a lack of data during this time period?
	*Using the data available for both analyses was difficult due to the lack of underlying information, however, generalized trends can be pulled from both sets.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	*There is a correlation between summer months and successful theater outcomes
	*Successful and failed theater outcomes decline from October to December

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

	*Goals of 50000 or more tend to decline, presumably due to the limitations of a larger goal overall.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	*Number of participants
	*Amount of time that both datasets encompasses
	*Additional information is needed in order to complete the analysis of both datasets
	*There is only a subset of overarching information within this dataset.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	*Histogram to view the outcomes based on goals
	*Box and whisker plot to determine trends of outcome based on launch date
